A question on Quora: 
[SIFS (short inter frame spacing) is the shortest or longest time required by WIFI standard for sending ACK back to originator?](https://www.quora.com/unanswered/SIFS-short-inter-frame-spacing-is-the-shortest-or-longest-time-required-by-WIFI-standard-for-sending-ACK-back-to-originator)

In WIFI, after a packet is sent to peer, ACK packet is expected from the peer if peer receives the packet correctly. SIFS is always mentioned as timing requirement.

“Peer has to wait for at least SIFS before sending ACK”. Does that mean the spacing before ACK could be longer in real implementation?
